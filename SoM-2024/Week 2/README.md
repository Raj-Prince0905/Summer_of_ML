# Week 2

Week 2 is all about going deep into the topic of machine learning. Learning various mathematical equations and how they help is solving various problems related to the dataset. Learning algorithms and common issues to the dataset and how we can handle them. Analysis of data without going deep into the dataset.

## Topics
- Outlier Analysis
- Handling Missing Values
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Cost Function and Gradient Descent
- Regression Analysis
- Linear Regression in one and multiple variables
- Logistic Regression in binary and multiclass classfication
